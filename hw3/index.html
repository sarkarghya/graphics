<b>A note about this week's course notes and assignment:</b>

   We went over a lot of topics in class this week. For next week (Oct 9),
   I am only going to ask you to finish implementing the Matrix object
   class at the bottom of these notes. Meanwhile, feel free to work on
   reflection, refraction and other ray tracing topics that interest you.
   Your work on those techniques can be used toward an assignment that
   will be due two weeks from now, on October 16.</font></big>


<big><big><b>NOTES ABOUT RAY TRACING</b></big></big>


<b>REFLECTION IN RAY TRACING</b>

    (1) Shoot ray (V, W) to find the point P on the surface and the surface normal N.

    (2) Use P, W and N to find a reflection direction R:

    	R = W - 2 (N&#149;W) N

    (3) Shoot a ray from (P + &epsilon; R, R) into the scene, for some very small &epsilon;.

    (4) If an object is hit by this ray, do surface shading, and mix into the final color.

<b>REFRACTION IN RAY TRACING</b>

    (1) Shoot ray (V, W<sub>1</sub>) to find the point P<sub>1</sub> on the surface and surface normal N<sub>1</sub>.

    (2) Use Snell's law <b>sin(&theta;<sub>1</sub>)/sin(&theta;<sub>2</sub>) = n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub></b> to find direction W<sub>2</sub> of the refracting ray into the object:

	C<sub>1</sub> = (N<sub>1</sub>&#149;W<sub>1</sub>) * N<sub>1</sub>
	S<sub>1</sub> = W<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>1</sub>
	S<sub>2</sub> = n<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>2</sub> * S<sub>1</sub>
	C<sub>2</sub> = - &radic;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">1-S</SPAN><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> * N<sub>1</sub>
	W<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> + S<sub>2</sub>

    (3) Shoot ray (P<sub>1</sub> + &epsilon; W<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>) to find the point P<sub>2</sub> where the ray exits the object.

        If the object is a sphere, you will need to find the second of its two quadratic roots.

    (4) Repeat the refraction calculation. This time use the normal N<sub>2</sub> at P<sub>2</sub>, and reverse n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub>.

	C<sub>3</sub> = (N<sub>2</sub>&#149;W<sub>2</sub>) * N<sub>2</sub>
	S<sub>3</sub> = W<sub>2</sub> - C<sub>3</sub>
	S<sub>4</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> * S<sub>3</sub>
	C<sub>4</sub> = &radic;<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">1-S</SPAN><sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup> * N<sub>2</sub>
	W<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>4</sub> + S<sub>4</sub>

    (5) Shoot ray (P<sub>2</sub> + &epsilon; W<sub>3</sub>, W<sub>3</sub>) into the scene.

    (6) If an object is hit by this ray, do surface shading, and mix into the final color.

<b>RAY TRACING TO THE INTERSECTING OF TWO OBJECTS</b>

    Suppose we want to find the intersection C of two objects A and B along ray (V,W).

    Suppose also that the ray enters A at t = A<sub>in</sub> and exits A at t = A<sub>out</sub>.

    Similarly, suppose the ray enters B at t = B<sub>in</sub> and exits B at t = B<sub>out</sub>.

    The intersection C of the two objects along the ray is then given by the interval:

       C<sub>in</sub> <small> </small>= max(A<sub>in</sub>, B<sub>in</sub>)
       C<sub>out</sub> = min(A<sub>out</sub>, B<sub>out</sub>)

    If C<sub>in</sub> > C<sub>out</sub>, then the ray has missed C.

<b>RAY TRACING TO A PLANE</b>

    The equation of plane L = [a,b,c,d] is given by: ax + by + cz + d = 0

    In other words, plane L consists of all points (x,y,z) for which ax + by + cz + d = 0

    To intersect ray V+tW with plane L, we just need to substitute variables:

       a(Vx + t Wx) + b(Vy + t Wy) + c(Vz + t Wz) + d = 0

    When we represent V and W as 1x4 column vectors:

        Vx     Wx
        Vy     Wy
        Vz     Wz
        1      0

    it becomes clear that the intersection of the ray and the plane can be expressed as:

       L&#149;V + t L&#149;W = 0

    From this we can see that we can solve for t by:

       t = -L&#149;V / L&#149;W

    Suppose we are using L to describe the boundary of a half space. Then:

       If L&#149;W &lt; 0 then the ray is entering the half space.
       If L&#149;W &gt; 0 then the ray is exiting the half space.

<b>RAY TRACING TO A TRIANGLE</b>

    We can find out whether any ray intersects a triangle by first precomputing four plane equations.

    The first plane contains the triangle's three vertices A,B,C.

        (1) Normalize the cross product (B-A) x (C-B) to get N<sub>0</sub>.

    	(2) Plane L<sub>0</sub> = [ N<sub>0</sub>x, N<sub>0</sub>y, N<sub>0</sub>z, -A&#149;N<sub>0</sub> ]

    Then for edge A,B we can compute plane L<sub>1</sub> as follows:

        (1) Normalize the cross product (B-A) x N<sub>0</sub> to get N<sub>1</sub>.

	(2) Plane L<sub>1</sub> = [ N<sub>1</sub>x, N<sub>1</sub>y, N<sub>1</sub>z, -A&#149;N<sub>1</sub> ]

    Similarly we can use edges B,C and C,A to compute planes L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub>.

    Now we have everything we need to determine whether any ray V+tW intersects the triangle:

        (1) Compute point P where ray V+tW intersects L<sub>0</sub>

	(2) P is inside the triangle iff L<sub>1</sub>&#149;P < 0 and L<sub>2</sub>&#149;P < 0 L<sub>3</sub>&#149;P < 0

<b>RAY TRACING TO A GENERAL QUADRATIC SURFACE</b>

    We are going to go over this topic next week in more detail,
    so I am going to hold off for now on notes about this.

<b>THESE MATRIX PRIMITIVES ARE VERY USEFUL</b>

    The value of each primitive 4x4 matrix as it is stored in column-major order:

    Identity            =  [ 1  0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  1  0    0  0  0  1 ]

    where c = cos(theta) and s = sin(theta).

<b>BUILDING A MATRIX LIBRARY</b>

   A matrix library lets you combine matrix primitives in different
   ways, and then use the resulting matrices to transform vectors.
   Following is a partial implementation in Javascript of a Matrix
   handling object class. <font color=blue>The parts in blue</font> are not yet implemented.
   For homework I would like you to implement those missing parts.

   function Matrix() {
      this.identity = () => value = [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1];
      this.translate   = (x,y,z) => value = multiply(value, [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, x,y,z,1]);
      this.rotateX     = theta   => <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      this.rotateY     = theta   => <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      this.rotateZ     = theta   => <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      this.scale       = (x,y,z) => <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      this.perspective = (x,y,z) => <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      this.get = () => value;
      this.set = v => value = v;
      this.transform = vector => {
         <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      }

      let value = [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1];

      let multiply = (matrix1,matrix2) => {
         <font color=blue>// You need to implement this.</font>
      }

   }
